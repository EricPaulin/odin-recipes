    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>
        French omelette recipe that translates to "Cheese Omelette" (when spelled correctly). Very delicoius and a good recipe to 
        practice heat control with. All credit goes to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8q8LsYbDCmM">Binging With Babish</a>
        as I used his recipe.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>4 Eggs</li>
        <li>Kosher Salt</li>
        <li>Gruyere cheese, shredded</li>
        <li>1 Tbsp unsalted butter</li>
        <li>Butter, for finishing</li>
        <li>Flaky Salt</li>
        <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>Chives, chopped</li>
        
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Start by cracking 4 eggs into a large bowl with a pinch of kosher salt and beat vigorously. 
            Strain into a separate bowl through a fine-mesh sieve. </li>
        <li>In a small bowl, shred a small batch of gruyere cheese. </li>
        <li>On the stovetop, preheat a carbon steel pan over medium heat. After 60-90 seconds, add 1 ta
            blespoon of unsalted butter.</li>
        <li>Once the butter is foamy and melted, add in the eggs and make sure to keep it moving by shak
            ing the pan and stirring the eggs vigorously over medium heat. Quit stirring the moment the 
            eggs are no longer liquidy. </li>
        <li>Drop the heat down to low. Tilt the pan away from oneself and shake it pushing the majority 
            of the omelette to that side. </li>
        <li>Using a rubber spatula, begin rolling the omelette starting from the near end and stopping o
            nce reached halfway. </li>
        <li>Run the spatula underneath the omelette to make sure it is loose, keep the pan tilted down, 
            and tap it propping the other end up. </li>
        <li>Fill the propped up end with the gruyere cheese and carefully fold the far end down over the 
            roll. Work quickly to prevent any browning.</li>
        <li>Once the omelette is rolled up, quickly remove it from the pan to a plate and smear it down 
            with butter. </li>
        <li>Season lightly with flaky finishing salt, a twist of freshly ground black pepper, and some 
            fresh chopped chives. </li>

    </ol>
